#Vigenere Cipher:
The Vigen√®re cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher in classical cryptography. It utilizes a keyword to determine variable shift values for each character in the plaintext. This introduces complexity by employing multiple cipher alphabets. While historically significant, modern cryptanalysis methods, such as frequency analysis, can compromise its security.

#Luhn Algorithm:
The Luhn algorithm, also known as the modulus 10 or mod 10 algorithm, is a checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. It verifies the numerical integrity of the digits, ensuring the accuracy and validity of the provided number.

#Shortest Path first:
The shortest_path function calculates the shortest paths and distances in a weighted directed graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. It takes a graph, a starting node, and an optional target node. It initializes distances and paths, iterates through nodes, updates distances, and prints the shortest path and distance from the start to the target.
