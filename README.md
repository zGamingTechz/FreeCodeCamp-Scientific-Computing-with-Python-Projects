#Vigenere Cipher:
The Vigen√®re cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher in classical cryptography. It utilizes a keyword to determine variable shift values for each character in the plaintext. This introduces complexity by employing multiple cipher alphabets. While historically significant, modern cryptanalysis methods, such as frequency analysis, can compromise its security.
